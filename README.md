# Clean-and-prepare-a-raw-dataset
This project focuses on essential data cleaning techniques using both Python (Pandas) to prepare datasets for further analysis. Clean data is a critical foundation for accurate analytics and insights, and this repository showcases the following preprocessing steps


🧹 Key Cleaning Steps:
✅ Identify and handle missing values
Use isnull () in Python and Filters in Excel to detect and manage missing data.

✅ Remove duplicate entries
Utilised drop_duplicates () in Pandas and Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” to eliminate redundant rows.

✅ Standardise categorical text fields
Cleaned inconsistent entries (e.g., Education and Martial Status) for uniformity.

✅ Convert date formats
Ensured consistent date formats across all records (e.g., dd-mm-yyyy) using pd.to_datetime()

✅ Rename columns
Applied clean and consistent naming conventions (lowercase, underscores, no spaces) to improve readability and usability.

✅ Check and fix data types
Validated and converted data types appropriately (e.g., age as int, dates).
